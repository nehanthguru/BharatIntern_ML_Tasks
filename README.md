# Machine Learning Projects Showcase
 
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing three distinct machine learning projects. These projects focus on wine quality evaluation, and iris flower species classification, with datasets obtained from Kaggle.
 
 
## Project 1: Wine Quality Assessment
 
**Overview:**
Dedicated to predicting wine quality using both linear regression and random forest models, this project involves the following stages in the Jupyter notebook:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Data Oversampling for Quality Balance
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Creation (Linear Regression and Random Forest)
- Evaluation Metrics Computation for Both Models
- Utilizing the Random Forest Model for Predictions on New Data
 
 
## Project 2: Iris Flower Species Classification
 
**Overview:**
This project focuses on classifying different species of iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals using logistic regression. The Jupyter notebook includes the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Encoding Categorical Data (Species Column)
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Development (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation Metrics Calculation
- Making Predictions on New Data
 
 
## Datasets
 
The datasets for these projects were obtained from Kaggle, a renowned platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The specific datasets used in these projects are available on Kaggle.
